CTR_Toolkit - make_cia - Generates CIA files
Version: 4.0 2013 (C) 3DSGuy

/******** Change Log ********/

Version 4.0:
* Code made "cleaner"
* "NTR" Platform removed. It is not possible to generated 'Valid' CIA files from NTR content.
* Many bugs, were fixed namely
  - Content Settings in config file, could be mistakenly read (fixed)
  - Multiple Content error, preventing successful install for CIAs with multiple contents
* Method order for generating CIA was made more versatile. This however sacrifices the memory efficency of version 3, and may cause low ram computers to freeze with large content.
* Experimental ROM(CCI/CSU) to CIA conversion
  - Maintains NCCH order/index from ROM
  - Content is encrypted
* Integration with CTR_SDK made easier.
  - make_cia can be compiled two ways, depending if "_DEBUG_KEY_BUILD_" is defined or not
  - CTR_SDK users can simply import the CTR_SDK data to dev_keys.h, and uncomment "#define _DEBUG_KEY_BUILD_", this fixes the certchain, commonkey/rsa keys, and the TMD/Ticket "Issuers"
  - Otherwise leaving "#define _DEBUG_KEY_BUILD_" commented, in dev_keys.h, make_cia will function with v3 input, to obatain/generate data.
* "GenerateMeta" option removed.
  - Savedata size, and title version is obtained from a CXI ExHeader(which can be encrypted), in addition the meta data. As a result make_cia, will attempt decryption to obtain prior mention data, but will only notify the user if decryption was not possible.
  - "SaveDataSize" (in KB) can now be manually specified under "BuildSettings"

Version 3.0:
* Initial Public release
* Supports generating valid CIA files
* Supports generating CIA files for CTR 

/******** Usage: ********/

Usage: make_cia <options>

OPTIONS                 Possible Values       Explanation
 -h, --help                                   Print this help.
 -v, --verbose                                Enable verbose output.
 -k, --showkeys                               Show the keys being used.
 -c, --config_file      File-in               CIA Configuration File.
 -r, --ncsd             File-in               Convert NCSD Image to CIA.
 -o, --output           File-out              Output CIA file.
 
Examples:

make_cia -c project\build.cfg -o app.cia
make_cia -c project\build.cfg -r project\app.cci -o app.cia

NOTE: The nature of this program lets you have a larger "input" into the CIA creation process(in contrast to ctr_makecia32), so a wide variety of titles(and some not yet created at time of writing) can still be packaged with this program. However this also means that incorrect input can lead to invalid CIAs, so be careful.

A big thanks to neimod, as the API for the polarssl crypto lib is based on his implementation in ctrtool. And special thanks to Jl12 and yellows8.
